* The search bar will be put at the top of the weather cards.
* The weather conditions will now be located at the bottom of the search history.

## Usage
Users can use this project to help them check the weather in a specific city so they can prepare. The application also keeps the users search history so they can easily refer back to a previous search. Same locations will only be saved once in the search history so the log will be easy to view.
